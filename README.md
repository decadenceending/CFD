Computational Fluid Dynamics:
Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations

SIMPLE is one of the algorithms used in computational fluid dynamics.
It can help identify appropriatge pressure of the system, based on
initial pressure guess and initial velocity field guess.

The algorithm is based on Navier-Stokes and "Stokes Problem."
The general idea is to identify corrected pressure. 

User can enter pressure guess, velocity guess, using a complete system
matrix, total number of velocitynodes, initial velocity.

The program can be executed using IDE such as Visual Studio.
